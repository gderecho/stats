#Stats

A simple statistics calculator. Currently, it is a static webapp
that calculates one-variable statistics and does two-proportion
z-tests.

Features include:
 * Mathjax rendering
 * Highcharts histogram and boxplot

If you want to run this app on a local machine, please run a
local web server. Otherwise, some browsers will fail the 
file:/// requests. My test setup uses nginx.
