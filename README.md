#Stats

[A basic statistics calculator.](http://gderecho.github.io/stats/#/onevar)

Currently, it is a static webapp that calculates one-variable statistics and does two-proportion z-tests.


Features include:
 * Mathjax rendering
 * Highcharts charts

I recommend using Chromium/Chrome or the latest version of
IE on a computer (not a phone). Some of the popovers don't
seem to work with the latest version of Firefox/Iceweasel.

If you want to run this app on a local machine, please run a
local web server. Otherwise, some browsers will fail the 
`file:///` requests. My test setup uses [nginx](http://nginx.org/).
